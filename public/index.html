                <p><small>Welcome to <i>CS3640 Introduction to Networks and their Applications</i></small></p>

                <p><small><b>Why:</b> Computer networking can seem enormously complex -- after all, the Internet is
                        arguably the largest engineered system ever built by humans! The Internet has had a
                        transformative impact on all aspects of modern society, yet it began as a research curiosity
                        just 50 years ago. This course offers a first look at what computer networks are, how they are
                        designed and operated, and how they are likely to evolve in the future.</small></p>

                <p><small><b>Who:</b> This course is primarily designed for undergraduate computer science majors. We
                        expect proficiency in computer systems and computer organization. To meet these requirements,
                        you will need a minimum grade of C- in CS2210, CS2230, and CS2630/ECE3350. In addition, you
                        should be comfortable with programming in Python.</small></p>

                <p><small><b>New in 2021:</b> Due to its large size, this course will be delivered online. Every class
                        will feature a spot quiz that covers the topics of that day. We have done away with the
                        traditional written exams, and in their place, introduced technical interviews. You will also
                        learn how to read and digest Internet RFCs and research papers. Finally, we will have a
                        distinguished lecture from <a

                        co-developed more than 80 Internet RFCs).</small></p>
